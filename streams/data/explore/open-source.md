Open source, I believe, is one of the most fundamental principles of not only a healthy market, but a powerful way of being, at a fundamental level.

A great argument can be made that it is not the best business model. But I would argue that it is indeed the ultimate, if <em>you</em> can properly align with its underlying values.
